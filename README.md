# osparc_api_example
A repository containing a "standalone" sample project that illustrates the use of the osparc API.

USE:
1) Login to osparc.io, and create a new project. 
2) Initialize a new JupyterLab Sim4Life service from the service catalog (a non-Sim4Life flavor should also work).
3) Clone all files in this repo into your "workspace" (/home/smu/work/workspace).
4) Edit api.env by filling in your public and private keys for the osparc client in the spaces indicated.
5) Run the cells in "api_example_nb.ipynb".
